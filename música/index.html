        <h1> If I Ain't Got You</h1>
        <h2>De Alicia Keys</h2>
        <p> Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah </p>
        <p> Some people live for the fortune <br>
            Some people live just for the fame <br>
            Some people live for the power, yeah <br>
            Some people live just to play the game</p>
        <p> Some people think<br>
            That the physical things<br>
            Define what's within<br>
            And I've been there before<br>
            That life's a bore<br>
            So full of the superficial</p>
        <p> Some people want it all<br>
            But I don't want nothing at all<br>
            If it ain't you, baby<br>
            If I ain't got you, baby</p>
        <p>Some people want diamond rings<br>
            Some just want everything<br>
            But everything means nothing<br>
            If I ain't got you, yeah</p>
        <p>Some people search for a fountain<br>
            Promises forever young<br>
            Some people need three dozen roses<br>
            And that's the only way to prove you love them</p>
        <p>Hand me the world<br>
            On a silver platter<br>
            And what good would it be?<br>
            With no one to share<br>
            With no one who truly cares for me?</p>
        <p>Some people want it all<br>
            But I don't want nothing at all<br>
            If it ain't you, baby<br>
            If I ain't got you, baby</p>
        <p>Some people want diamond rings<br>
            Some just want everything<br>
            But everything means nothing<br> 
            If I ain't got you, you, you</p>
        <p>Some people want it all<br>
            But I don't want nothing at all<br>
            If it ain't you, baby<br>
            If I ain't got you, baby</p>
        <p>Some people want diamond rings<br>
            Some just want everything<br>
            But everything means nothing<br>
            If I ain't got you, yeah</p>
        <p>If I ain't got you with me, baby<br>
            Oh, whoo-ooh<br>
            Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing<br>
            If I ain't got you with me, baby</p>
